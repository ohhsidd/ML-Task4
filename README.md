# Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project is part of my learning journey in Python and Machine Learning. It uses the popular Iris flower dataset to predict the species of a flower based on measurements like petal and sepal length.

## 📌 What this project does

- Loads the Iris dataset
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Checks the model accuracy
- Predicts the flower type based on input features

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension
3. Run the notebook cells one by one
4. Change input values to test predictions
